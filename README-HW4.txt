Chess bot for CS 442 with Bart Massey, Portland State University

Homework 4

For the final assignment I implemented transposition tables. 
For some reason it does not seem to offer significant
improvement in performance. I will have to experiment with
changing the size of the transposition table and perhaps
other factors to see if I can get a performance increase.

Adding in transposition tables did not seem to seriously 
break the bot, so I'm calling it a success given the 
time constraints.
